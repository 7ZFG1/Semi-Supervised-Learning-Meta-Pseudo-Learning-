# Semi Supervised Meta Pseudo Learning

I made this project with reference the following article.

Firstly you should run the ```train_teacher.ipynb```. This code provides to train your labeled dataset.

Then run the ```prepare_unlabeled_dataset.ipynb```. This code provides to prepare your unlabeled dataset. There are 2 augmentation method. Adding noise and cut-out. You can choose one of them or use both of them.

And then run the ```make_pseudo_labels.ipynb```. This code provides producing pseudo labels for your augmented unlabeled dataset.

And then run the ```train_student_model.ipynb```. This code provides to train your augmented pseudo labeled dataset. You should use your teacher model weight as a pretrained model.

Lastly run the ```inferance.ipynb```. This code provides to save predict result as a cvs file.
